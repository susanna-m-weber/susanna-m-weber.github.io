## Research 
I’m currently a Biomedical Engineering Ph.D. student at Columbia University, where I'm advised by [Dr. Christoph Juchem↗](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/christoph-juchem) as part of the [MR SCIENCE Lab↗](https://juchem.bme.columbia.edu/). My resarch focuses on multi-coil cardiac shimming - improving the homogeneity of the B0 field to acquire diagnostically useful images at high fields.
