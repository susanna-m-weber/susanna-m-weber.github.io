## Research 
I’m currently a Biomedical Engineering Ph.D. student at Columbia University, where I'm advised by [Dr. Christoph Juchem↗](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/christoph-juchem) as part of the [MR SCIENCE Lab↗](https://juchem.bme.columbia.edu/). My resarch focuses on designing and building coils for multi-coil cardiac shimming - improving the homogeneity of the B0 field to acquire diagnostically useful images at high fields.

## Past Projects

**Cardiac MRI Segmentation Using U-Nets** \
_Columbia University, BMEN 4460 | May 2023_
Implemented different an attention U-Net based architecture to segment the inner and outer wall of the right ventricle. The model was pre-trained using a 2D whole heart segmentation task using magnitude cardiac scans. Ventricle segmentation was performed on  short axis cine scans from the [The Right Ventricle Segmentation Challenge dataset](https://rvsc.projets.litislab.fr/). The current iteration of the model achieves a test DICE score of 0.8, on par with the leading three published models trained on the challenge dataset (see [Tran et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00494)).

**ALULA Avionics System** \
_Berkeley STAR | August 2022 - May 2023_
As the avionics lead for Berkeley's competition rocketry team, STAR, I oversaw the design and integration of the electronics in system used in the liquid engine test stand. We designed, assembled, and tested PCBs used during hot fire tests of the team's first liquid engine rocket. I and the rest of the avionics subteam were rsponsible for  control and monitoring of combustion during hotfire, which included integrating  sensors, microcontrollers, and communication systems. Adapted versions of these circuit board designs were implemented in STAR's first liquid engine flight vehicle, ALULA. 

**MR to CT Translation Using Deep Learnign** \
_GE HealthCare | May 2022 - August 2022_
During my internship in the MR Applied Science Lab at GE Healthcare, I implemented a number of transformed-based architectures as well as generative adversarial networks for segmentation + identification of anatomical features in MR scans and modality translation, respectively. Both paired and unpaird approaches to MR to CT translation were tested using an implementation based on CycleGAN. 

**Automated Photometry Measurements with MAM** \
_Max Plank Institute for Physics | May 2021 - July 2021_
- test test
